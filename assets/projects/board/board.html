        <h1 class="section-title">PUBLIC HEARING AT BOARD MEETING</h1>

        <p class="board-p">Public Hearing at Board Meeting
        The Board of School Trustees recognizes that its deliberative process benefits greatly from public input and perspective. Those wishing to address the Board may sign up to speak by calling the Board Office at 702-799-1072 during regular business hours and at least 3 hours prior to the scheduled start of the meeting. Alternatively, speakers may sign up in person immediately prior to the beginning of the meeting. Prior to each agenda item being voted on, members of the public are allowed to speak on the item after the Board's discussion and prior to their vote. Since approval of the consent agenda may be approved in one motion, members of the public wishing to speak on a consent agenda item may speak prior to the vote. Those members of the public who are speaking on 4 or more items will be allowed a total of 10 minutes. Customarily, speakers will be called in the order in which they signed up. No person may sign up for another individual. No person may yield his or her time to another person. Generally, a person wishing to speak on agenda items will be allowed 3 minutes to address the Board.</p>
